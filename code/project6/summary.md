# Visualizing the content of our dreams

## Summary
What is the most frequent topic in our dreams. What colours, relatives, strange places, people and creatures visit our nights?

## Details
By using machine learning, the idea would be to explore the content of thousands of dreams contained in collections of dream reports.

**Possible headline(s):** Reading people dreams

**Data set(s):** http://www.dreambank.net/

**Code repository:** 
    
**Possible problems/fears/questions:** 

## Work so far
Scraped thousands of dreams from the dreambak website
