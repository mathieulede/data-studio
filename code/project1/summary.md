## Pitch

The Fine Arts Collection is one of the nation's oldest and largest public art collections. It consists of mural and easel paintings, sculptures, architectural and environmental artworks, as well as prints and other works on paper dating from the 1850s to the present. These civic artworks are displayed in federal buildings and courthouses nationwide. The Fine Arts Collection serves as a reminder of the important tradition of individual creative expression.
Together, these thousands of historical and contemporary artworks that are displayed and maintained as part of the Fine Arts Collection chronicle the rich and complex history of the United States, enhance the experiences of citizens interacting with their government, and constitute an enduring and irreplaceable cultural legacy for the nation.

I want to focus on basic perceptions. Size of the average frame, surface occupied by all these frames. I want to give the idea of the real nuber of pieces of arts by creating a wall
