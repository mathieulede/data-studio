# What differentiates doodles from drawings

## Pitch
Millions of drawings have been collected by Google to feed a neural network capable of recognizing what is beeing drawn. Anyone can take part in the research. A concept is given to you, you have 20 seconds to draw it.
I would like to focus this project on the unrecognized drawings from the dataset. The drawings that were to bad or to different from what the system expected.
As each drawing is geolocalized, it is possible to find which population has done the highest percentage of unrecognized drawing for each concept. It is also possible to get which concept is the hardest to draw or how many different lines does it require to draw, for example, an apple or a car.

## Summary
>The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories, contributed by players of the game Quick, Draw!. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located.

## Details

**Possible headlines**  

1. You versus the Neural Net
2. The drawings that resist AI
3. "I can't draw": Google feels the same way...

**Possible problems/fears/questions:**  
I have to merge a lot of datasets in binary format.

## Work so far
I Learned how to read and unpack the binary files in python and made a simple analysis for the "apple" concept.
