# How couples meet and stay together

## Pitch
People have answered questions about their sentimental life during six years. During this time, they maried, divorced, met new partners, had children, etc.
I would like to draw a map of the relations/events that lead to a relationship and its possible evolutions.
For example, the number of relations involved in the chain that link two people before they meet.
If that doesn't work, I still can simply show the evolution of few selected couples (by religion, income, etc.), with up and down, break-up, children and other events during six years. Could be represented as a timeline.

## Summary
>How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) is a study of how Americans meet their spouses and romantic partners.
