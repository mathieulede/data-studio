# Pitch

## Summary
How the episodes are built in term of rhythm. By visualizing the timeline of the dialogues extracted from the TV show subtitles, some patterns show up. The waves of intensity throughout the episodes can be seen when no dialogue occurs. I would like to find a common rule of how and when the moments of actions or contemplation are used in the episodes and whether or not there is an evolution during the seasons.

## Details
By using only the timestamp of each episode subtitles, a visual score can be extracted. The blanks in this score are the moments when no dialogue occurs. These scenes give a sense of how the episode has been constructed.
