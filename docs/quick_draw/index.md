# The drawings that defeat Google
It seems seems that we are on the verge of letting important decisions be taken by computers. Not only in our everydays Facebook news feed or in our future autonomous car but also in the social field. With judgments, studies that leads to politics decisions etc. **But what is lost in this process?** Algorithmic systems tend to avoid what is not the norm, exclude eccentricity and prevent errors. But errors and eccentricity are what makes creativity and what makes humans human.

Millions of doodles from all around the world have been collected by Google to feed a **neural network** capable of recognizing what is beeing drawn. This system learns by himself and is the perfect illustration of a machine learning application.

What can we learn from the **rejected drawings**?

<br/><br/><br/>Google's dataset shows that the most recognizable drawings are also the simplest ones. On this graphic, the average complexity and percentage of reconizable drawings have been plotted. The coutries that use a logographic writting system, with a strong pictural culture, are the coutries that produce the most accepted drawings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>South Africa and Hungary are the coutries that produce the most unrecognized drawings. Reasons?<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>AI is everywhere in the news and it seems that we are on the verge on letting some decisions be taken by computers. But **what is lost in the process?** Is AI making everything average, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

**Time to decieve Google's expectations!**
